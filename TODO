To-do items for random.portfolios.Rnw and also for the matching.portfolios package.

1) Change name of package to "matching.portfolios"

2) Do we really need lmSolve and MatchingPortfolios in DEPENDS? If not delete them. And make sure package passes R CMD check.

3) Check in the latest version of the matching.portfolios.Rnw pdf into the doc directory at the end of each day.

4) Clean up the dreck from the doc directory. That is, it is fine if creating the vignette makes some temporary files (.tex, .log and so on) but these should not be part of the repository. After you delete them, add them to .gitignore so that they are not checked in. And I guess this is way it is useful to have a .gitignore that is part of the repository. This is a file that we all need and should use in common.
