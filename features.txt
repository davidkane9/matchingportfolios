Feature List: Random Portfolios
==============

-single period
----Create random portfolios matching constraints (check)
----Long/short
----Transaction Costs
----randomize number of stocks in portfolio
----check if bad universe or unsolvable
----inequality constraints
-multi period
----Start with random portfolio and continually resample
----Use sign statistics to measure skill of model
-Diagnostics
----Compare returns
----Estimate overlap between portfolios
--------Euclidian distance and correlation (is large correlation bad?)
--------Comparisons to uniformly distributed portfolios of similar size
----Plot, Summary, show -- 
----Intuitive error messages
-Vignette
----Explain problem: Sampling from Convex Polytope
--------Calc-Volume: NP-Hard, random algorithms used to approximate
----Go over what a "convex polytope" is
----Demonstrate randomness
----Pretty graphics
--------histograms of returns
----Explain how can be used to judge portfolios


Usage:

randPort(originaldata, originalPortfolio) + match("country", "US") + set("value", 0) + size(200) + generate()

kmatch 
=======

----able to match exposures for a general problem
----setting and matching
----includes hitandrun and mirror
----overlap should be a function in this package
