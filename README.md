WilliamstownWeather
===================

A repo for Michaela and Angel to get used to using Github and to show off their new R skills.


Hi guys, here are some steps to get started using git:

- Download git
- Create a folder on your Desktop called WilliamstownWeather
- Open git bash, type: `cd Desktop/WilliamtownWeather`, and type `git init`
- After that is done, type `git pull git@github.com:mjfwilliams/WilliamstownWeather`
- Now you should have a folder called Rstuff, put all your R code, data, and .rnw files in there
- After you do that, (one of you) type `git add *`
- Now to commit changes, type: `git commit -m "Added all our files!"`
- Finally, type `git push git@github.com:mjfwilliams/WilliamstownWeather`
