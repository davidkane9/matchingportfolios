\section*{Minimizing distance from the origin}

The thought process behind this idea was so: We need to get a point
from the inside of a polytope, given the constraint equations. These
equations give us a k-plane that will always go through the plane:
$x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n = 1$. Since the ``triangle'' defined by the
intersection of this plane and the constraints $x_i > 0$ is already
very close to zero, I assumed that any intersection of this plane with
another constraint would automatically have it's closest point within
the ``triangle'', however, this is only true if the intersection
``goes through the triangle'' in the first place, or so it seems.

\noindent The derivation is as follows:

\noindent The contraint equation $Ax=b$ can be though of geometrically
as sequentially restricting $x$ to plane by plane, with each row of
$A$ being a plane. It is a basic result of linear algebra that any
plane can be represented by the equation $ n * x = c$ where n is a
vector that is normal to the plane, and c is some constant. This is
exactly what the rows of $A$ are, normal vectors. This will help
because the shortest distance between a point and a plane is the
perpendicular distance between them, and therefore this distance
vector must be in line with a normal vector. For this distance from
the origin, this vector must be the position. It follows that:
