  \begin{abstract}
    We propose a portfolio performance measure which compares the
    return of a target portfolio against the return of a
    \emph{matching portfolio} sharing the same exposures but holding
    different stocks. Treated as a benchmark, a matching portfolio
    provides an estimate of alpha because it shares the same
    characteristics as the target portfolio. Matching portfolios have
    three advantages over characteristic portfolios
    \citep{daniel97.1}. First, they can be matched on any number of
    characteristics without any overlap with the target
    portfolio. Second, matching portfolios can mimic any weighting
    structure, e.g., long-short and 130/30. Third, matching portfolios
    provide a measure of uncertainty for alpha.\footnote{An R package,
      which reproduces the results of this paper, is available upon
      request.}

All performance measurement techniques set up a counterfactual world
in which the portfolio invested in similar --- but not identical ---
securities. The counterfactual represents something an investor could
have done, usually simply. The portfolio is said to be successful if
it outperforms the counterfactual portfolio, commonly called a
benchmark. In practice, the most common benchmark is a well-known
passive portfolio like the S\&P 500. The counterfactual is
straightforward: the money could have been invested in the S\&P 500
instead of the portfolio, and the benchmark shows how that alternative
strategy would have performed.

The problem with a simple benchmark like the S\&P 500 is that it can
give an inaccurate view of performance. First, the manager can lie
about his benchmark, picking one after the fact to make his
performance look as good as possible. Second, the manager may never
set a benchmark in the first place. Third, he may specify a poor
benchmark, one that is not appropriate for his strategy. Fourth, there
may be no clear benchmark to specify, as with a long-short equity
portfolio.

One approach is to focus on stock characteristics, as in
\citet{daniel97.1} and \citet{daniel97.2}. These authors define their
benchmark as a combination of passive portfolios mimicking the target
portfolio's exposures to a set of characteristics, usually size,
book-to-market and momentum. The universe of stocks is divided into a
5 x 5 x 5 matrix based on quintiles of these three
characteristics. For each of the 125 characteristic cells, a passive
portfolio is created using a value-weighted combination of the stocks
in the cell. The final benchmark is a weighted combination of these
portfolios matching the exposures of the original portfolio.

A characteristic benchmark corresponds to a counterfactual world in
which the alternative portfolio has the same characteristics as the
target portfolio and is selected from the same universe of
stocks. Comparing the benchmark's performance to the target
portfolio's performance yields an estimate of stock-picking ability,
or alpha, that is not biased by these specific
characteristics. \citet{kothari01} find this to be the most accurate
among five competing benchmarks.

Still, there are problems with characteristic benchmarks. First, they
do not scale well with increasing numbers of characteristics because
of the exponential growth in the number of cells. With five
characteristics, there are $5^5 = 3,125$ cells, almost all with a
small number of stocks. The benchmark overlaps with the target
portfolio, increasingly so as the number of characteristics
grows. Overlap is undesirable because it makes the benchmark and
target portfolio too similar. Second, it is unclear how the
characteristic-based approach applies to portfolios with short
positions.

Our approach to benchmark construction applies the statistical
matching literature \citep{wilks32, cochran73, rubin73.1, rubin73.2}
for matching one subject to another based on a vector of
covariates. For each security in the portfolio, we seek a match (a
security not in the portfolio) with a similar vector of stock-specific
characteristics. Using the causal model of \citet{rubin74}, we reframe
the problem of identifying a manager's alpha to that of identifying
causal effects. Our estimate of alpha is the difference between the
portfolio's return and the return of a characteristic-matched
benchmark.

Our paper introduces a more general framework for constructing
characteristic-matched portfolios, providing more precision and
flexibility. It is more precise because we allow for an arbitrary
number of characteristics and levels per characteristic. It is more
flexible because we allow for alternative portfolio weightings, such
as long-short, 130/30 and so on.

\section{Background}

A benchmark can be viewed as a counterfactual portfolio: a set of
securities that the manager \emph{could have} invested in, but chose
not to. These securities must come from some
universe. \citet{bodie01.universe} define a \emph{comparison universe}
as a group of securities with similar risk characteristics. This forms
the set of securities from which we will construct counterfactual
portfolios for performance evaluation.

A common benchmark is a passive portfolio like the S\&P 500. The
problem with this is the makeup of the S\&P 500, which is often
different from the universe of investments the manager actually
considered. Even if the stocks in the S\&P 500 are contained in the
universe, these stocks may be different from those in the portfolio:
They may have larger capitalization or come from different
sectors. Relative to the S\&P 500, differences in performance could be
caused by sector and cap weighting, as opposed to stock-picking
ability. A benchmark that is matched by sector and cap would provide a
better indicator of the manager's alpha.

The appropriate benchmark depends on the source of the manager's
claimed advantage. The benchmark should be similar to the portfolio in
every characteristic \emph{except} those the manager claims as his
advantage. For example, some managers make conscious bets on sectors
or other characteristics. Consider a manager who believes that energy
stocks in general will outperform the market and who therefore has a
large exposure to the energy sector. A benchmark matched on the same
sector weights will not measure the manager's purported ability to
time sectors. The benchmark must \emph{not} be matched on the
characteristic of presumed advantage. However, it is still desirable
that the benchmark be matched on all other characteristics.

In the most common case in which stock-picking ability is the presumed
advantage, the benchmark should be as closely matched to the target
portfolio as possible on all characteristics. Here, the manager's
claim is that stocks just like his will do worse than his
stocks. Using a benchmark with the same characteristics isolates the
manager's stock-picking ability. It removes competing explanations for
the manager's excess return.

\subsection{Rubin Causal Model}
\label{SectionRubin}

Performance evaluation falls neatly into the Rubin Causal Model, a
statistical framework for causal inference. \citet{rubin73.1} develops
matching techniques in which treated units are compared with
near-identical untreated units to measure the causal effect of a
treatment.

To understand the Rubin Causal Model, consider an experimental setting
in which a researcher desires to estimate a drug's ability to cure
headaches. Ideally, he would run a randomized experiment, randomly
assigning subjects with headaches to drug and placebo (or control)
treatments. This makes the characteristics (age, gender, health status
and so on) of the treated and control populations identical in
expectation. Any difference in headache incidence after treatment is a
result of the drug.

Unfortunately, a randomized experiment is often prohibitively
expensive or unethical. Then the researcher must resort to an
observational study, in which treated and control units are found
wherever possible (e.g., from patients in a hospital). In this
setting, treatment assignment is non-random. Comparing the headache
rate in the treated and untreated population is no longer proof of
causality because confounding factors could be at work. For instance,
perhaps males are more likely both to take the drug and to have
headaches go away naturally. This gender effect could be mistaken as
the drug's treatment effect.

\citet{rubin73.1}, \citet{rubin73.2}, \citet{rubin74} and
\citet{rosenbaum83} develop a series of matching techniques to
counteract bias in an observational study. For every treated unit,
matching identifies a near-identical control unit, based on every
observable covariate (e.g., race, gender, income, weight, etc.). The
comparison in headache rates is made across matched units, where the
treatment effect is measured as the difference in response between the
treated and matched control units. Intuitively, the goal is to make
the observational study look as much like a randomized experiment as
possible.

Venture capital provides a useful financial analogy. The venture
capitalist spreads his money around a variety of small companies. The
infusion of capital is a treatment, and the resulting
growth (or decline) in the companies is a treatment effect. The
venture capitalist cannot observe the \emph{potential outcomes}: how
unchosen companies would have performed had they received capital, or
how chosen companies would have performed had he not invested in
them. He can instead use a matching method to determine the causal
effect of his capital. He can compare two similar companies, one that
received venture capital and one that did not. Their difference in
outcomes constitutes an estimate of the treatment effect.

Identifying stock-picking skill presents a similar challenge. The
inclusion of a stock in a portfolio can be considered a treatment. The
treatment effect is the excess return experienced by a stock in the
portfolio, all characteristics being equal. Matching the portfolio
holdings to similar non-holdings provides a precise estimate of the
treatment effect.

There is also an important difference between this problem and the
Rubin Causal Model framework. In an observational study, potential
outcomes are not observed. In the portfolio problem, potential
outcomes are observed because returns are available for all stocks,
even those outside the portfolio. We can easily determine the return a
manager would have enjoyed on a matched portfolio (ignoring the price
impact of his own trading), even though the investor did not actually
commit her money to it. We use this difference to our advantage in our
performance evaluation, computing the returns on a collection of
matched portfolios.

\subsection{Random Portfolios and Characteristic Portfolios}
\label{SectionExisting}

A simple approach to creating a counterfactual portfolio is to ``throw
darts'' at the universe, picking random stocks for a portfolio. This
was suggested as long ago as \citeyear{lorie65} by
\citeauthor{lorie65}. Since then, several variants have been proposed,
such as the ``Average Investment Performance Index'' of
\citet{cohen66}, which simply assigns random positive weights to every
stock in the universe, rescales them to add to 1, and treats the
result as a single draw of a random portfolio. Repeating this many
times, they measure the performance of mutual funds against the
average of the ``random investments.''  \citet{dawson03} and
\citet{burns04} further refine the idea by using the same universe of
stocks that the manager used. These \emph{random portfolios} (RPs)
represent a concrete counterfactual, but do not share the
characteristics of the target portfolio. Instead, the portfolios have
the same exposures on average as the universe. Their average return is
the same as that of an equal-weighted benchmark spanning the universe.

The characteristic portfolios (CPs) of \citet{daniel97.1} match the
target portfolio's exposures to three characteristics: size,
book-to-market ratio and prior-year return. The universe is first
broken into a 5 x 5 x 5 matrix based on quintiles of these
characteristics. A benchmark is created for each of the 125 cells,
made up of a value-weighted mix of stocks in that cell. The
characteristic portfolio is an average of these benchmarks, weighted
to match the exposures of the target portfolio to each of the 125
cells. ``alpha'' is defined as the difference in returns between this
and the target portfolio.

One problem with this approach is the curse of dimensionality that
arises when extending it beyond these three characteristics. Using
more characteristics creates a combinatorial explosion of cells, with
few stocks per cell. This leads to significant overlap in holdings
between the target and benchmark portfolios, which grows as
characteristics are added. A second problem with CPs is that they
cannot handle long-short target portfolios.

Our method, matching portfolios (MPs), is more precise because it
tackles the curse of dimensionality, allowing arbitrary numbers of
characteristics. Even when there is no perfect match for each stock,
our MPs mimic the overall exposures of the target portfolio. They are
also constrained not to share any stock in common with the target, so
there is no overlap. Finally, MPs are more flexible because they work
for any type of portfolio -- long-short, 130/30 and so on.

\section{Data}

All three methods (MPs, CPs and RPs) require holdings data. Portfolio
returns alone are not enough; we need the composition of the portfolio
at every date under consideration. Performance measurement using
holdings is preferred by several authors because it is more accurate
and can work even with only a single time period
\citep[see][]{grinblatt89,grinblatt93,kosowski06}.

As a concrete example, consider a sample portfolio using stock ratings
from StarMine, a San Fransisco-based research company. The ratings
come from \Sexpr{perf.date}. The company had data on
\Sexpr{formatC(nrow(s1.all), big.mark = ",")} stocks from a global
universe. Of these, it rated
\Sexpr{formatC(sum(!is.na(s1.all[["smi"]])), big.mark = ",")}. The
StarMine Indicator is a rating from 1 (worst) to 100 (best). The
ratings are intended to be percentiles and are roughly uniformly
distributed. The data also include the characteristics listed
below. Figure \ref{FigureStarMine} shows distributions of the
characteristics and the forward return.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Country} in which the company is headquartered
  \item \textbf{Sector} in which a majority of the company's business
    takes place
  \item \textbf{Market capitalization} (\textit{Cap}) in USD
  \item Average \textbf{dollar volume} (\textit{Vol}) of the past 20 trading days

  ratio (``B/M''), sales-to-market ratio (``S/M''), momentum measured
  as prior 12-month return (``Ret.12.0.m'') and reversal measured as
  prior one-month return (``Ret.1.0.m''). Also shown is one-month
  forward return (``Ret.0.1.m''), by which benchmark and portfolio
  returns will be compared. The universe is comprised of
  \Sexpr{nrow(s1.all)} stocks considered by StarMine, a San
  Francisco-based research company, on \Sexpr{perf.date}. Of these,
  StarMine rated \Sexpr{nrow(s1)}. Both rated and unrated stocks
  appear in the histograms above.}
\label{FigureStarMine}
\end{figure}

Consider a long-only portfolio, equally weighted among the
\Sexpr{n.port} highest-rated stocks. That portfolio returns
\Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.port)} over the following month. In
comparison, the complete universe returns
\Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.uni.all)}, the rated universe
\Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.uni)} and the S\&P 500
\Sexpr{formatpercent(0.036)}. These figures tell varying
stories. Compared to the S\&P, the portfolio looks good; compared to
the equal-weighted complete universe, it looks great. But we seek to
measure the selective power of the StarMine portfolio after
controlling for these eight characteristics.

\section{Characteristic Portfolio}
\label{SectionCharacteristics}

Before describing our approach, we briefly outline the CP
method. Construct 125 value-weighted passive portfolios, one for each
cell of a 5 x 5 x 5 grid of quintiles of market cap, book-to-market
and momentum. These cells are shown in Figure \ref{FigureDaniel}, with
dots representing portfolio holdings and non-holdings in the
investable universe. The cells are carved out by dashed grey
lines. The \emph{characteristic style} measure is the difference in
return of the target portfolio and a combination passive portfolio
with the same exposure to the 125 cells. Here, it is
\Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.port - perf.dan)}, indicating positive
alpha. The characteristic portfolio aims to match the StarMine
portfolio's exposures on cap, book-to-market and momentum. While the
CP succeeds in matching the exposures of these three characteristics,
there are potentially differences in the other characteristics. For
example, imagine that the CP is over-exposed to Japan. If Japanese
stocks rise strongly, the CP will tell a misleading story.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Curse of Dimensionality}

The curse of dimensionality prevents us from including more
characteristics. The problem arises either with greater numbers of
characteristics or with a characteristic of high cardinality, such as
sector. Adding sector yields $5^3 * 10 = $1,250 cells in the
matrix. Almost all cells will have few stocks. Within each cell there
are few alternatives to the stock already found in the target
portfolio because it is hard to find stocks matching on all four
characteristics. The passive portfolios become heavily weighted in the
same stocks as the original portfolio. This leads to large overlap
between the CP and target portfolio. In the extreme case of one stock
per cell, the two portfolios are identical. In the statistical
literature, the method of characteristics is an example of
\emph{caliper matching} \citep{cochran73}, which is known to suffer
from the curse of dimensionality as the number of matching factors
grows large.

\subsection{Overlap}

The curse of dimensionality leads to significant overlap between the
target portfolio and the CP. Overlap poses a major problem for
performance measurement because it makes every portfolio look average,
generating false negatives when assessing managers' alpha. With CPs,
these false negatives become increasingly common as the number of
characteristics grow and this overlap weight increases. We define the
overlap as the sum of the weights shared by the two portfolios,
$$ \sum_i \text{min}(w_i, \tilde{w}_i), $$
where $w_i$ and $\tilde{w}_i$ represent the weights of the target
portfolio and the CP, and the sum spans all universe securities $i$.

  (``B/M''), sales-to-market ratio (``S/M''), momentum measured as
  prior 12-month return (``Ret.12.0.m'') and reversal measured as

  each label represents the addition of a new characteristic in the
  benchmark. The $y$ axis shows overlap between the target StarMine
  portfolio and the CP including all characteristics up to the current

  25\% overlap in a CP using cap, book-to-market, momentum and country
  characteristics and a corresponding CS alpha estimate of about
  1\%. The universe is comprised of \Sexpr{nrow(s1)} stocks rated by
  StarMine, a San Francisco-based research company, on
  \Sexpr{perf.date}. The portfolio is an equal-weighted mix of the
  \Sexpr{n.port} top-rated stocks from this universe.}
\label{FigureOverlap}
\end{figure}

For the StarMine portfolio, Figure \ref{FigureOverlap} shows how the
overlap grows with the number of characteristics. Using three
characteristics gives a modest overlap of
\Sexpr{formatpercent(overlap[1,3])}. When country and sector are
added, this jumps to \Sexpr{formatpercent(overlap[1,5])}. Over half
the benchmark's weight is in the target portfolio. This overlap surge
pushes the performance of the CP closer to the performance of the
target portfolio. Increasingly, the two look alike, bringing the CS
alpha estimate to zero. Indeed, in the second panel, we can see the CS
measure dropping from over 4\% with one characteristic to nearly zero
with all eight characteristics. Increasing overlap is the culprit.

\section{Matching Portfolio}
\label{SectionMatchingPortfolio}

Having seen how characteristic portfolios can fail, consider a
matching portfolio (MP) for use as a benchmark. Like the CP, the MP
measures performance by comparison against a benchmark with the same
characteristics. Unlike the CP, the MP can match exposures to any
number of characteristics and never overlaps with the target
portfolio.

\subsection{Finding Matches}

To motivate our method, we first demonstrate the visual process of
finding a matching portfolio. For display reasons, focus on three
characteristics: country, sector and cap. Figure
\ref{FigurePortfolioUniverse} shows the distribution of universe
stocks over these three characteristics. The black dots represent
holdings and the gray dots non-holdings. For most portfolio positions,
there's an abundance of close matches. A few holdings might have to
reach a bit farther across the market cap space for a match, such as
Hitachi and Havas, which are labeled in the figure. But by and large,
matches are plentiful and easy to find.

\begin{figure}
<<echo=FALSE, results=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6>>=

                  "Not in Portfolio"),
                par.settings = my.theme(col = gray(c(0.75, 0.00)), pch = 20),
                auto.key = list(columns = 2),
                panel = function(x, y, subscripts, ...) {
                  panel.stripplot(x, y, subscripts = subscripts, ...)
                  ctry <- paste(mf$country[subscripts[1]])
                  label.ind <- NULL
                  if (ctry == "JPN") {
                    # label Hitachi
                    label.ind <- which.max((y == "HiTec") * x)

                    # label Havas
                    label.ind <- which.max((y == "Other") / abs(x - 9.5))

\label{FigurePortfolioUniverse}
\end{figure}

The curse of dimensionality makes the problem harder when using the
full set of eight characteristics. A natural idea is to find a
``nearby'' stock for each holding under some notion of
distance. \citet{rubin73.1} investigates a variety of matching
approaches based on Mahalanobis distance, but finds that these make
increasingly poor matches as the number of dimensions grows.

\citet{rosenbaum83} solve the problem with the \emph{propensity
  score}, which is the estimated probability that a stock appears in
the portfolio, given its characteristics. The propensity score has an
important balancing property: stocks with the same propensity score
have the same characteristics on average. This reduces the
multidimensional problem of matching a group of characteristics to the
unidimensional problem of matching on the single propensity score.

A propensity score is estimated with a logistic regression over all
stocks, where the dependent variable is inclusion in the portfolio and
the indepednent variables are the characteristics. The propensity
scores are the fitted probabilities from this model.

\subsection{Procedure}

We next apply the work of \citet{rosenbaum83} to our setting. For each
stock in our target portfolio, we seek another, not in the target
portfolio, which has a similar PS. There are several ways to achieve
this computationally \citep{abadie06}. The simplest is
nearest-available matching \citep{cochran73}. For each portfolio
holding $i \in \{1, ..., n\}$,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the security $j$ that minimizes the absolute difference in
  PS. Add it to the MP with the same weight as holding $i$.
\item Remove security $j$ from the universe of possible
  matches. Matched holdings are selected \emph{without
    replacement}. This ensures that no stock appears twice in the MP.
\end{enumerate}

The propensity score's balancing behavior is a distributional
property. Balance is realized asymptotically, not at the level of the
individual match. While individual stocks may not appear matched, the
MP shares the target's exposures. Figure \ref{FigureExposure} compares
the exposures of the target portfolio and the MP. There are no points
of significant disagreement.

After finding an MP, alpha can be estimated as a simple difference of
returns from the target to the matched portfolio:
$$ \sum_i w_i r_i - \sum_i \tilde{w}_i r_i, $$
$r_i$ represents the forward return on security $i$, $\{ w_i \}$ the
portfolio weights of securities in the target portfolio and $\{
\tilde{w}_i \}$ the portfolio weights of securities in the matched
portfolio. $i$ indexes all stocks in the universe, $i \in \{1, ...,
n\}$, so $w_i = \tilde{w}_i = 0$ for most values of $i$.

The MP returns \Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.mat, digits = 1)} versus
\Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.port)} for the StarMine portfolio. In other
words, the StarMine portfolio's alpha is
\Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.port - perf.mat, digits = 1)}.

%% Need to add some material here about the overall results of the matching. What are the results of our cool procedure?


\subsection{Long-Short Portfolios}

A major advantage of MPs is their allowance for different weighting
strategies, such as non-equal-weighted long portfolios and long-short
portfolios. Managers have struggled to find reasonable benchmarks for
long-short portfolios. \citet{jacobs99} write that there are no
benchmarks suitable for a long-short portfolio besides the return on
cash. In our framework, we simply create a matching portfolio, where
each stock gets the same weight as its matching stock in the target
portfolio.

As an example, we create a long-short portfolio based on the StarMine
score. We divide the long side equally among the top 50-rated stocks
and the short position among stocks in the 50 lowest-rated stocks. The
total short position is 30\% of the long position, creating a 130/30
long-short portfolio. The long and short exposures of this portfolio
are given in Figure \ref{FigureLSMatchExposure}. The portfolio returns
\Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.ls)}.

Some of the mechanics of matching must change in the long-short
case. In the long-only case, the propensity score acts as a balancing
score so that on average, the MP has the same exposures as the target
portfolio. The process of computing the propensity score depends on
binary inclusion -- stocks must be either included in the portfolio or
not.\footnote{Previously we followed the Rubin Causal Model by
  analogizing a stock's inclusion in the portfolio to what
  \citet{rosenbaum83} call a \emph{treatment effect}. The variable
  $I_i$ associated with this treatment is defined to be one when stock
  $i$ is in the portfolio and zero otherwise. Matching on the PS
  $P(I_i = 1 | X_i)$ yields matched stocks with the same probability
  of inclusion in the portfolio, which guarantees exposure balance
  between the target and matched portfolio. The definition of this
  probability depends on the treatment indicator $I_i$ being a binary
  random variable.} We need a new balancing score in the long-short
case because inclusion is no longer binary.

We instead apply the \emph{generalized propensity score}
\citep{imai04}, which acts as a balancing score in the case of
negative and positive weights. Computing the generalized propensity
score is a natural extension of the procedure to compute the
propensity score. It is estimated with a simple linear regression over
all stocks, where the dependent variable is the stock's weight in the
portfolio and the indepednent variables are the characteristics. The
generalized propensity scores are the fitted values from this
model. The generalized propensity score has the same balancing
properties as the propensity score. To find the matching portfolio, we
use the same nearest-available matching procedure as we did in the
long-only case, using the generalized propensity score in place of the
propensity score.

Figure \ref{FigureLSMatchExposure} shows the long and short exposures
of the StarMine long-short portfolio and the MP. We can see that both
the long and short bets on each characteristic line up closely. The MP
returns \Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.ls.m)} compared with
\Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.ls)} for the target portfolio. This suggests
that the StarMine long-short portfolio exhibits stock-picking ability
above what would be expected for a long-short portfolio with similar
exposures.

  (``B/M''), sales-to-market ratio (``S/M''), momentum measured as

  this universe for the 130\% long side, and an equal-weighted mix of
  the \Sexpr{n.port/2} lowest-rated stocks for the 30\% short side.}
\label{FigureLSMatchExposure}
\end{figure}

\section{Uncertainty}

Above, we estimate the manager's outperformance as
\Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.port - perf.mat, digits = 1)}
for the long-only StarMine portfolio and
\Sexpr{formatpercent(perf.ls - perf.ls.m, digits = 1)}
for the long-short StarMine portfolio. Naturally, we might wonder how
variable these estimates are. How confident are we that the manager
has positive alpha?

In order to generate a confidence interval, we need to average over
the various sources of uncertainty associated with our estimate. In
this case, the most important source is the specific stocks selected
for the MP. Although the MP has similar characteristics to the target
portfolio, many other portfolios have similar characteristic
distributions and could also serve as matching portfolios. Referring
to Figure \ref{FigurePortfolioUniverse}, it is clear that each stock
in the target portfolio has many possible matches. Each of these
alternate matching portfolios would generate a different estimate of
alpha for the StarMine portfolio.

Instead of creating a single MP, consider creating 1,000.  Each MP is
random and unique, matched to the target portfolio on all
characteristics.  As such, each gives a different estimate of alpha,
the difference between its return and the target portfolio's
return. The 1,000 MPs thus provide a distribution of alpha, which
accounts for the variability in the possible matched
portfolios. Consider the percentage of random MPs, out of the 1,000,
for which the MP return exceeds the target portfolio
return. Statistically, this percentage can be viewed as a $p$-value
for the null hypothesis of zero alpha. It represents the probability
of a return more positive than the target portfolio's, under the
constraint of similar exposures.

While others \citep[see][]{burns04,dawson03} have used random
portfolios (RPs) in a similar manner, our approach is distinguished by
its emphasis on matching random portfolios. The RPs of these authors
do not share the same exposures as the target portfolio; instead, they
reflect the makeup of the universe. Our procedure for creating a
collection of random MPs is as follows.\footnote{There is a number of
  reasonable ways to do this. These steps may require tuning for other
  applications. In any specific application it is important to make
  sure that conclusions are robust to reasonable choices in algorithm
  selection and tuning. Details of our implementation are available
  upon request.}

For each holding $i$ in the target portfolio,

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find all possible non-holdings with propensity scores (or
  generalized propensity scores) within threshold distance of the
  original portfolio. This threshold must be tuned for the specific
  application, based on the composition of the universe and target
  portfolio. We use a threshold of 0.01.\footnote{This follows the
    procedure recommended by \citet{rosenbaum85} to form matching
    control sets.}
\item If the holding has at least one match, choose a non-holding
  uniformly at random from the set of matches. If the holding has zero
  matches, pick the nearest available non-holding. Add the match to
  the MP with the same weight it has in the original portfolio.
\item Repeat until all portfolio holdings have matches and the random MP is
  complete.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{FigureRandomPortfolioExposure} shows a set of 50 random
MPs for the long-only StarMine portfolio, generated using the
procedure above. Each bar shows the decomposition of bias in the
random MP's exposures by characteristic. Small bars reflect less bias
and greater similarity to the target portfolio. Two special bars are
included: one for the original, deterministic MP; and one for the
CP. While the deterministic MP is the closest to the target portfolio,
almost all the random MPs are still closer than the CP. Overall, the
biases range from 0.09 to about 0.19. The average bias is about 0.14,
which denotes a 14\% difference in the exposures of the target
portfolio and the average random MP.

\caption{The distribution of bias of 50 random, matching portfolios
  for the long-only StarMine portfolio. Bias is defined as the sum of
  the absolute differences between the benchmark and target
  portfolio's exposures. Lower bias reflects similar exposures in the
  target and benchmark portfolios. The regions of each bar show the
  decomposition of bias due to eight characteristics: country, sector
  and quintiles of market capitalization (``Cap''), prior 20-day mean
  dollar volume (``Vol''), book-to-market ratio (``B/M''),
  sales-to-market ratio (``S/M''), momentum measured as prior 12-month
  return (``Ret.12.0.m'') and reversal measured as prior one-month
  return (``Ret.1.0.m''). The universe is comprised of
  \Sexpr{nrow(s1)} stocks rated by StarMine, a San Francisco-based
  research company, on \Sexpr{perf.date}. The StarMine portfolio is an
  equal-weighted mix of the \Sexpr{n.port} top-rated stocks. The
  random matching portfolios are generated by finding a random match
  to each stock in the StarMine portfolio within a 0.01 propensity
  score threshold \citep{rosenbaum83}. Two special portfolios are
  included and labeled: the deterministic matching portfolio, made up
  of the closest-matching stocks; and the characteristic portfolio
  \citep[CP,][]{daniel97.1}.}

Having established that the random MPs are close to the target
portfolio, we next compare returns in Figure
\ref{FigureRandomPortfolio}.  The histogram shows the distribution of
MP returns along with a vertical line representing the target
portfolio's return. The StarMine portfolio outperforms
\Sexpr{formatpercent(mean(perf.port > ran.ret))} of the matching
portfolios, which provides mild, but not conclusive evidence of
positive alpha. Additionally, a 95\% confidence interval for the
outperformance is given by the bootstrap quantile method as
(\Sexpr{formatpercent(quantile(ran.ret, .025))},
\Sexpr{formatpercent(quantile(ran.ret, .975))}), which are the 2.5\%
and 97.5\% quantiles of the random MP returns.

\section{Conclusion}

We have shown that matching portfolios have three key advantages as
benchmarks over the characteristic portfolios of
\citet{daniel97.1}. First, matching portfolios avoid the curse of
dimensionality and permit an arbitrary number of characteristics,
thereby reducing bias by around 20\%. This helps isolate a manger's
stock-picking ability because the matching portfolio will have the
same distribution of characteristics as the target
portfolio. Characteristic portfolios can use only a few
characteristics before their overlap with the target portfolio, in
terms of specific holdings, grows too large. In contrast, matching
portfolios can be matched on as many characteristics as desired
without any overlap. Second, matching portfolios work with arbitrary
weighting schemes: long-short, 130/30 and so on. There is no published
implementation for characteristic portfolios in anything but the
long-only case. Third, matching portfolios provide a natural estimate
of uncertainty. Randomizing the matching procedure allows us to
generate a collection of random matching portfolios and extract a
confidence interval for the estimate of alpha. This is similar to the
measure of uncertainty used in the random portfolios of
\citet{burns04}, but different in that these are random matching
portfolios, sharing the characteristics of the target portfolio.
