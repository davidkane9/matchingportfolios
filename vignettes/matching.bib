  abstract = {This article develops and applies new measures of portfolio performance which use benchmarks based on the characteristics of stocks held by the portfolios that are evaluated. Specifically, the benchmarks are constructed from the returns of 125 passive portfolios that are matched with stocks held in the evaluated portfolio on the basis of the market capitalization, book-to-market, and prior-year return characteristics of those stocks. Based on these benchmarks, "Characteristic Timing" and "Characteristic Selectivity" measures are developed that detect, respectively, whether portfolio managers successfully time their portfolio weightings on these characteristics and whether managers can select stocks that outperform the average stock having the same characteristics. We apply these measures to a new database of mutual fund holdings covering over 2500 equity funds from 1975 to 1994. Our results show that mutual funds, particularly aggressive-growth funds, exhibit some selectivity ability, but that funds exhibit no characteristic timing ability.},

They employ the standard CAPM benchmarks and a variety of APT benchmarks to investigate this question. They find little similarity between the absolute and relative mutual fund rankings obtained from these alternative benchmarks, which suggests the importance of knowing the appropriate model for risk and return in this context. In addition, the rankings are not insensitive to the method used to construct the APT benchmark. Finally, they find statistically significant measured abnormal performance using all the benchmarks. The economic explanation for this phenomenon appears to be an open question.},

The study finds that the measures generally yield similar inferences when using the same benchmark and that inferences can vary, even from the same measure, when using different benchmarks. This paper also analyzes the determinants of mutual fund performance. Tests of fund performance that employ fund characteristics, such as net asset value, load, expenses, portfolio turnover, and management fee are reported. These tests surprisingly suggest that turnover is significantly positively related to the ability of fund managers to earn abnormal returns.},

  abstract = {In this paper, which is the first step in our efforts to produce an objective standard for use in measuring the investment performance of any portfolio of securities over some period of time, we introduce the average investment performance index (AIPI). The AIPI measures the average return which could have been realized during a particular time period from some specified universe of securities. Our reasons for constructing the AIPI are presented in Section I, where we also formally define the AIPI and discuss the random portfolios which conceptually underlie it. Section II is a mathematical development of the AIPI's properties. We find that the AIPI is equivalent to an unweighted arithmetic average of all actual returns in the given universe of securities, we show how to compute the variance of returns from all possible random portfolios, and we develop a method for linking the values of the AIPI across successive time periods. The use of the AIPI and the variance of random portfolio returns for rating the investment results achieved by portfolio managers is discussed and illustrated in Section III. We feel that the objective evaluations which are the basis of our illustrations should allow the reader to assess the applicability and implications of using the AIPI as a measure of investment performance.},
