\section*{Introduction}

Stuff about making random portfolios and why they are important.

\section*{Methodology}

\subsection*{getWeights}

\code{getWeights} takes equality constraints in the form of $$ E x = E
x_0$$ where $x_0$ is the weights of an original portfolio that we
desire to match. It also guarantees that all the output weights will
be positive. Starting from the original portfolio, we do a random walk
based in the null space of $E$. This guarantees that the equality
constraints will still hold via:$$ E(x_0 + v) = Ex_0 + Ev = Ex_0$$ if
$Ev = 0$ (the definition of a vector in the null space). To fully
sample the problem we have $v = Z*r$ where Z is a matrix whose columns
span the null space, and $r$ is a random vector whose coefficients
$r_i \sim N(0, 1)$. This can be interpreted geometrically as moving in
a random direction on the hyperplane that is the null-space. On each
step, \code{getWeights} checks if any of the weights are negative, if
they are, it projects the negative components onto the basis vectors
in $Z$ and subtracts those vectors from step. This guarantees that the
equality constraints will still hold, while none of the weights will
be less than zero.

\subsection{Example}

Consider a universe with only 3 stocks, and our only constraint is
that their weights must add up to 1. Let our original portfolio be
represented by the vector $x_0 = (.3, .3, .4)$. Our equality matrix $E$
can be represented by the one-row matrix $E = [1,1,1]$. All our
solutions are necessarily in the plane $x + y + z = 1$. To check if
\code{getWeights} does this, we can look at a scatterplot of the
results.

<<rcodeblockyeah>>=
library(scatterplot3d)
E = matrix(c(1, 1, 1), 1, 3)
x0 = c(.3, .3, .4)
w = getWeights(E, x0, 1000)
scatterplot3d(x = w[1,], y = w[2,], z = w[3,], angle = 160)
